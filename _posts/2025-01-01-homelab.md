## üß± Lab Architecture

Designed and built a self-hosted cybersecurity homelab replicating a real-life enterprise environment to gain hands-on experience in both offensive and defensive security operations. The lab simulates cyberattacks using tools like Nmap and other pentesting tools to understand attacker methodologies while leveraging Wazuh for log aggregation, threat detection, and incident response. This environment enabled practical learning of red team (attacker) and blue team (defender) workflows, enhancing skills in threat hunting, detection engineering, and SIEM management within enterprise-like network infrastructures.

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| `project-x-dc` | Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller | 
| `project-x-win-client` | Windows 10 Workstation | 
| `project-x-linux-client` | Linux User Endpoint | 
| `project-x-email-svr` | Email Server (SMTP/IMAP Simulated) | 
| `project-x-sec-box` | Wazuh SIEM (Rules, Alerts, Dashboards) | 
| `project-x-attacker` | Attacker Box (Kali Linux) | 
| `project-x-sec-work` | Blue Team Analyst Workstation |
