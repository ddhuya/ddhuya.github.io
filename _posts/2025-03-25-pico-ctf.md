### WebSockfish

#### Challenge Description
Can you win in a convincing manner against this chess bot? He won't go easy on you!

We were given a link directly to the website of this challenges. 

From the decrirption we know that in order to obtain the flag, we need to beat the bot in chess, However

The web uses StockFish chess engine, which is the most optimal chess engine currently and beating the bot using another engine against it won't give us the flag as well.

Therefore, let's examine how the websocket client is interacting with the server using burpsuite.

Upon making your chess move, the bot will then answers back with another move of its own.

Looking closely of the response to the server, we can see that the bot is using eval() function to response back to the server.

Thus, we have come to the conclusion that the bot is using the eval() function to evaluate its state in the current chess match. meaning that;

An eval() function with negative value will show that the bot thinking its losing whereas an eval() function with a positive value will show that its winning.

So how do we continue? We can manipulate the response from the bot to the server by using Burpsuite Repeater. HEAD OVER TO REPEATER!!!

Changing the value of eval() function to a very large negative number like -999999 and SEND!

There we go! The bot will automatically resigns thinking its loss the match and give us the flag.

Flag: __picoCTF{c1i3nt_s1d3_w3b_s0ck3t5_46c33d0c}__

YAY, we beat the best chess engine in just *ONE* move.
