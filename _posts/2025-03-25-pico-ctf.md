This is my Pico CTF 2025 challenges writeups.

## Web 

# WebSockfish

# Challenge Description
![WebSockfish Capture](https://github.com/ddhuya/ddhuya.github.io/blob/main/CTF/WebSockfish/Capture.PNG?raw=true)

From the decrirption we know that in order to obtain the flag, we need to beat the bot in chess, However

The web uses StockFish chess engine, which is impossible to beat by any means and using another engine against it won't give us the flag even if we win.

The hint suggest us to take a investigation into how the websocket interacts with the server
